ScalaServlet
============

This is a demo project.  The purpose is to show how to use Scala to make servlets.  This code is part of a presentation at Iowa Code Camp 2013.

The Maven build produces an executable fat jar that will launch the web application on localhost:8080.  You can change these values in the com.jyc.demo.main.Starter class.
